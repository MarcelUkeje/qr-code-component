## My process

I started off with the HTML markup, nesting the elements as they appeared.

I then consulted figma in order to get the font-styles, colours and other contributors to the layout. It was then a piece of cake to write the CSS for the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was beginner-friendly and so I did not find most of it difficult given my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. However, I did learn something new. I learnt how to make a page look the same on screens of different sizes and I did that using the "vh" measure for the minimum height.

I also learned the basics of how to use figma as I constantly consulted the figma files contained in the project so as to aid my code.

The code snippet is shown below.

```css
body {
    background-color: #D5E1EF;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

At the moment, I still struggle with getting the page to appear exactly as I want it to.

For example, I want to be able to choose whether or not I want the page to be scrollable. This was not part of the requirements but I find it useful to have full control over my work.

I want to get to a point where I can easily create any effect I want and can easily spot the cause of undesirable effects. That is what I am working towards at the moment.


### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) - I have found TOP to be very helpful, and it was a pleasant surprise to see that some of the creators of the resources which are linked inside of it are mentors in the community.
